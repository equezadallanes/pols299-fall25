## Purpose

The goal of this assignment is to help you apply concepts and findings from the course material to a current event of your interest in American politics and to communicate your analysis and conclusions to a general audience.


## Task

Write an op-ed for [The Spire](https://hcspire.com/) on a topic related to the course (no actual submission to the paper necessary). Your op-ed may address a current policy debate, news story, or political science finding you think would help you and your peers understand contemporary American politics. The op-ed should be between 600-1,200 words (single-spaced, 12-point font, 1-inch margins). Use Times New Roman or Arial font.

An op-ed is a short opinion piece intended for the general readership of a publication. Many academics write op-eds as a way to communicate their research to people outside their field that they believe could help illuminate an important political event.

In your op-ed, make sure to include at least *two pieces of information* (e.g., concepts, ideas, frameworks, contextual information) that you learned in class and found particularly helpful for your understanding of this topic to make your argument.

Please include a word count under the title.

1. Have an effective lede (i.e., hook) and a clear thesis statement.
2. Identify at least two concepts/ideas/information from class.
3. Provide persuasive evidence for the argument.
